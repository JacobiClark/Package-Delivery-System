# Package Delivery System

This application reads delivery package lotations in a CSV adjacency list, creates a graph containing the distance from each location to all other locations, and utilizes the greedy algorithm to genrate a short delivery path. The delivery trucks also have limited gas and room for packages, which is also accounted for while generating delivery lists.
